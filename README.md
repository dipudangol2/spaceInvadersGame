# Space Invader Game

This is a simple Space Invader game built using the Pygame library. I followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w){:target="\_blank"} tutorial from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/){:target="\_blank"}on YouTube.

## Installation

Before running the game, make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system.

### Setting up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to run the game in a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

1. Create a new virtual environment:
   python3 -m venv env

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     .\env\Scripts\activate
   - On macOS and Linux:
     source env/bin/activate

### Installing Dependencies

- Once you have the virtual environment activated, install the required dependency (Pygame) using pip:
  pip install pygame

### Running the Game

- With the virtual environment activated and Pygame installed, you can now run the game:
  python main.py

### How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to move your spaceship left and right.
- Press the spacebar to shoot bullets at the invading aliens.
- Your objective is to shoot down as many aliens as possible before they reach the bottom of the screen.

### Controls

- Left Arrow: Move the spaceship left
- Right Arrow: Move the spaceship right
- Spacebar: Fire lasers

### Project Structure

- **main.py**: Contains the Python source code for the game.
- **resources/**: Contains all the images, sounds and fonts used in the game.
